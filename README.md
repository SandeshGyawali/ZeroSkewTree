Implementation of 4 Approximation Algorithm of Zero Skew Tree in Rectilinear Space![image](https://github.com/SandeshGyawali/ZeroSkewTree/assets/50552743/1ac1a7ca-9c6c-4919-85aa-1f8a395472a1)

In the input.txt file you need to put the edges that you have in your graph. 
Example: if your graph has an edge between node 1 and node 5, an edge between node 5 and node 2, then simply write the following:
1 5
5 2

The input.txt file is given as input to the Java class. The program will then write the output in the file zero_skew_tree.txt
